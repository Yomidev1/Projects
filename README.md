I designed and deployed a Production ready web service in Azure using terraform to provision my infrastructure and ansible as an automation tool Terraform was used to provision Linux_virtual_machine, subnets, network_interface, resource_group, security_groups and other infrastructures

Ansible was used as an automation tool to configure Apache2, mysql and deploy an index.html file link to the index.html: http://104.214.233.32/index.html or http://104.214.233.32/ Link to ApacheTomcat: http://104.214.233.32:8080/

for Ansible installation in Ubuntu check Ansible.sh
